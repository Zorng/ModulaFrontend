# Inventory Module — Feature Module Spec (Capstone 1)

**Version:** 1.5  
**Status:** Patched (Aligns with Sale integrity guarantees when cash session is not required; no scope loss)  
**Module Type:** Feature Module  
**Depends on:** Auth & Authorization, Tenant & Branch Context, Policy & Configuration, Menu (recipe mapping), Sync & Offline, Audit Logging  

---

## 1. Purpose

The Inventory Module enables tenants to manage **stock items**, **stock categories**, **restock batches**, and **branch-level stock quantities**, while maintaining a complete and immutable history of all stock changes.

The module is designed to:
- Support recipe-based stock deduction from sales
- Provide accurate per-branch and aggregated inventory visibility
- Preserve data integrity through append-only journals
- Allow flexibility during setup while enforcing operational limits

---

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### Includes
- Full CRUD for **Stock Items**
- Full CRUD for **Stock Categories**
- Full CRUD-like lifecycle for **Restock Batches** (no hard delete)
- Append-only **Inventory Journal**
- Per-branch stock tracking in base units
- Aggregated stock view across branches (Admin)
- Expiry-date tracking per batch
- Enforcement of tenant soft/hard limits

### Excludes
- Supplier management
- Purchase orders
- Stock transfer between branches
- FIFO / FEFO enforcement
- Automated reorder alerts
- Inventory analytics (Capstone 2)

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 Stock Item
A physical inventory object such as Milk, Coffee Beans, Cups, or Sugar.  
Each stock item has a **base unit of measurement** (ml, g, pc) used consistently for deduction and reporting.

### 3.2 Stock Category
An optional grouping for stock items (e.g. Dairy, Packaging).

### 3.3 Uncategorized (System-Derived)
- If a stock item has **no category assigned**, it is treated as **“Uncategorized”**
- “Uncategorized”:
  - Is system-derived (not persisted)
  - Cannot be edited, renamed, or deleted
  - Does not count toward category quota

### 3.4 Restock Batch
A record of stock received for a specific stock item at a specific branch, optionally with expiry and cost metadata.

### 3.5 Branch Stock
The current available quantity of a stock item at a branch, expressed in base units and **derived from journal entries**.

### 3.6 Inventory Journal
An immutable, append-only log of all stock changes:
- Restocks
- Sale deductions
- Manual adjustments

### 3.7 Branch Lifecycle (Important Boundary)
- **Branches are system-created** (not created by Admin/Manager directly), as part of tenant onboarding or subscription changes (Capstone 2 billing engine; Capstone 1 developer/admin tooling).  
- The Inventory Module only:
  - Lists and lets users **select from existing branches** in tenant context
  - Enforces **branch status constraints** (e.g., disallow operations on frozen branches)

### 3.8 Integrity Guarantees for Stock Mutations (New, Locked)
Inventory integrity must hold **regardless of whether cash sessions are required for sales**. Cash-session policy affects cash-accountability UX, not inventory correctness.

Locked rules (Capstone 1):
1. **Append-only journal is authoritative**  
   Stock levels are computed from journal entries; no mutation may “rewrite history”.
2. **Idempotent deductions and restocks**  
   Operations that can be retried (offline replay, network retries, double submit) must not create duplicate journal entries.
   - For sale deductions: the system must be able to detect “already deducted for this sale”.
3. **Concurrency-safe deductions**  
   When multiple devices/users finalize sales concurrently, deductions must not produce inconsistent totals (e.g., missing deductions or duplicated deductions).  
   (Note: preventing negative stock may be a business rule; integrity here means consistent, auditable mutation.)
4. **Server-authoritative processing order**  
   Client timestamps may be recorded for audit but must not be used as the primary ordering mechanism for correctness. The backend processes mutations in a consistent server-controlled order.

---

## 4. Policy Dependencies (Branch-Scoped)

> **Important:** Inventory behavior is controlled by **branch-scoped** policy values (Policy & Configuration module).  
> When performing inventory actions, the system must resolve the **effective policy for the selected branch context**.

### Policies Used
- `inventoryAutoSubtractOnSale` (boolean)
  - If `true`, finalized sales trigger recipe-based stock deduction for that branch.
- `inventoryExpiryTrackingEnabled` (boolean)
  - If `true`, restock batches require/enable expiry date tracking and expiry-based views.

### UC-12 — Sale-Based Stock Deduction (Integrity-Locked)

**Actor:** System (triggered by Sale module upon finalization)

#### Preconditions
- Sale finalized
- Branch context is known for the sale
- **Branch is ACTIVE (not frozen)**
- Effective policy for the sale branch:
  - `inventoryAutoSubtractOnSale = true`
- Menu item has recipe mapping

#### Main Flow
1. Sale module finalizes sale (server-side).
2. Inventory deduction is triggered for the sale’s branch as part of the finalize operation.
3. System:
   - Calculates required quantities (base units) from recipe mapping × quantity sold
   - Appends journal entries (SALE_DEDUCTION), referencing sale ID
4. Branch stock is updated from journal state.

#### Integrity Rules (Locked)
- **Atomicity:** sale finalization + journal append(s) + derived stock update must behave atomically from the system perspective (no partial completion visible).
- **Idempotency:** if the same sale finalize is retried (offline replay / network retry), the system must not append duplicate SALE_DEDUCTION entries.  
  Minimum requirement: detect “deduction already applied for sale_id”.
- **Concurrency safety:** multiple finalizations occurring concurrently must not cause missing or duplicated deductions.

#### Postconditions
- Stock decreased correctly for the sale branch
- Journal references sale ID
- Deduction is auditable and replayable

## 6. Functional Requirements

- FR-1: Stock items support full CRUD with soft delete
- FR-2: Base unit immutable once referenced
- FR-3: Restock quantity cannot be edited
- FR-4: Inventory journals are append-only
- FR-5: Category assignment optional
