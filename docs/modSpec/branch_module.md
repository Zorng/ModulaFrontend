# Branch Module (Core)

**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** Revised (Branch provisioning is system-driven)  
**Module Type:** Core Module  
**Depends on:** Auth & Authorization (Core), Tenant & Branch Context (Core)  
**Related Modules:** Subscription/Billing (Phase 2), Sale & Orders, Inventory, Cash Session, Staff Attendance, Reporting, Receipt/eReceipt, Policy, Audit Logging

---

## 1. Purpose

The Branch module manages the **lifecycle state and profile** of branches under a tenant, including:
- Maintaining branch profile (name, address, contact)
- Controlling branch operational status (ACTIVE/FROZEN)
- Providing branch identity as a consistent reference for branch-scoped modules

**Branch provisioning is NOT user-driven.** Branch records are created by the system when:
- A tenant is provisioned (tenant provisioning creates an initial/default branch), and/or
- A subscription item entitles additional branches (Phase 2 billing engine), and/or
- Developers provision branches manually (Capstone I temporary approach)

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 System-Provisioned Branches
Branches are created by a **provisioning process**, not by Admin UI.
- Capstone I: provisioning may be performed by developers (manual command/seed/admin tooling)
- Capstone II: provisioning is performed automatically by Subscription/Billing

### 2.2 Branch Status
- `ACTIVE`: operations allowed
- `FROZEN`: operations blocked (read-only allowed)

### 2.3 Branch Guard Rule (Cross-cutting)
Any operation that creates or mutates branch-scoped operational records requires:
- `branch.status == ACTIVE`

---

## 3. Use Cases

### UC-1 Provision Branch (System)
**Actors:** System (Provisioning workflow), Developers (Capstone I provisioning only)  
**Preconditions:**
- Tenant exists
- Provisioning trigger occurs:
  - Tenant provisioned (creates default branch), or
  - Subscription upgrade entitles extra branch (Phase 2), or
  - Developer executes provisioning command (Capstone I)

**Main Flow:**
1. Provisioning workflow requests branch creation for a tenant.
2. System creates a new branch record with `status = ACTIVE`.
3. System returns the new branch identifier.
4. (Optional) System attaches default branch settings (e.g., default receipt footer empty).

**Postconditions:**
- Branch exists and is available for assignment (staff, inventory, sales contexts).
- Audit log entry recorded (if audit is enabled).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No end-user UI allows “Create Branch”.
- Branch creation is only accessible via system provisioning path.
- Provisioned branch is `ACTIVE` by default.

---

### UC-2 Update Branch Profile
**Actors:** Admin  
**Preconditions:**
- Actor authenticated as Admin
- Branch exists (provisioned)

**Main Flow:**
1. Admin selects an existing branch.
2. Admin updates branch profile fields (name/address/contact).
3. System validates and persists.

**Postconditions:**
- Branch profile updated.
- Audit log recorded.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can update profile fields for any branch in the tenant.
- Manager/Cashier cannot update branch profile.

---

### UC-3 Freeze Branch
**Actors:** Admin  
**Preconditions:**
- Actor authenticated as Admin
- Branch exists and is `ACTIVE`

**Main Flow:**
1. Admin selects branch → “Freeze branch”.
2. System sets branch to `FROZEN`.

**Postconditions:**
- Branch Guard Rule blocks operational writes for that branch.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When frozen, the system blocks:
  - Creating cart / adding items to cart (if you enforce guard at cart stage)
  - Finalizing sales/orders
  - Opening cash sessions / writing cash movements
  - Inventory restock/adjust/journal writes
  - Attendance check-in/out
- Read-only access remains (reports/history).

---

### UC-4 Unfreeze Branch
**Actors:** Admin  
**Preconditions:**
- Actor authenticated as Admin
- Branch exists and is `FROZEN`

**Main Flow:**
1. Admin selects branch → “Unfreeze branch”.
2. System sets branch to `ACTIVE`.

**Postconditions:**
- Operational actions resume.

---

### UC-5 List Branches
**Actors:** Admin, Manager, Cashier  
**Preconditions:**
- Actor authenticated

**Main Flow:**
1. System returns accessible branches:
   - Admin: all branches
   - Manager/Cashier: assigned branch only (Capstone I)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Branch visibility respects role + assignment.

---

## 4. Requirements

### Functional
- Branch profile update (Admin)
- Freeze/unfreeze (Admin)
- Branch list (role-scoped)
- System provisioning hook (non-UI)

### Non-functional
- Enforcement must be server-side
- Audit trails for update/freeze/unfreeze/provision
