## Module: Staff Management (Feature Module)

**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** Patched (Aligned with Branch creation model + Capstone 1 boundaries)  
**Module Type:** Feature Module  
**Depends on:** Auth & Authorization (Core), Tenant & Branch Context (Core), Policy & Configuration (Core), Audit Logging (Core)  
**Related Modules:** Staff Attendance, Cash Session, Reporting, Branch (Core/Context)

---

## 1. Purpose

The Staff Management module manages **workforce membership within a tenant**:
- Who can access a tenant’s POS
- What **role** they have (Admin / Manager / Cashier)
- Which **branch** they are assigned to (when applicable)

This module focuses on **organizational access**, not personal identity or credentials.

Personal account data (password, OTP verification, phone ownership, account recovery, display name changes) belongs to **Authentication & Account Settings**, not this module.

---

## 2. Scope (Capstone I)

### Included
- Inviting staff into a tenant
- Assigning branch and role (from existing branches)
- Activating, disabling, archiving, and reactivating staff memberships
- Enforcing staff seat limits (soft & hard limits)
- Viewing staff list and status
- Audit logging of staff lifecycle changes

### Explicitly Not Included
- Creating branches (branches are system-created)
- Password reset / OTP flows
- Phone verification
- Editing personal account details (name, credentials)
- Payroll or HR data
- Attendance mutation (handled by Attendance module)

---

## 3. Key Clarification: Branches Are System-Created (Not User-Created)

Branches do **not** originate from Staff Management.

Branch lifecycle is created/expanded by the **system**, driven by:
- Initial tenant provisioning (system creates the first branch when tenant is created)
- Subscription upgrades that add branch capacity (future billing engine; currently developer-admin flow)

Staff Management can only:
- **Select** from existing branches that belong to the tenant
- Assign staff to those branches
- Respect branch state (e.g., frozen/disabled branches cannot receive new assignments)

---

## 4. Core Concepts

### 4.1 Staff Membership
A record linking a **User Account** to a **Tenant**, defining:
- Role (Admin / Manager / Cashier)
- Branch assignment (where applicable)
- Membership status

### 4.2 Invitation
A temporary record created by Admin to onboard staff into a tenant.

### 4.3 Staff Status
- **INVITED**: Invitation sent, not yet accepted
- **ACTIVE**: Staff can access POS
- **DISABLED**: Temporarily blocked from access (does not consume an active slot)
- **ARCHIVED**: Permanently removed from active use (counts toward hard limit)

---

## 5. Actors

- **Admin (Tenant)**
- **Manager (Branch)**
- **System** (automation and cross-module enforcement)

---

## 7. Data Integrity Rules

- Staff memberships are immutable in identity (user ID never changes).
- Archived staff remain in records for audit/history.
- No hard delete of staff in Capstone I.
- Attendance and sales reference staff by stable IDs.

---

## 8. Requirements

- R1: Only Admin can invite, disable, archive, reactivate, or reassign staff.
- R2: Staff limits are enforced via:
  - Soft limit = maximum ACTIVE staff memberships
  - Hard limit = maximum ACTIVE + ARCHIVED staff memberships
- R3: Managers have read-only visibility for their branch staff.
- R4: Staff Management does not handle credentials or account identity data.
- R5: All staff lifecycle changes must be audit logged.
- R6: Staff cannot be assigned to a frozen branch.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria (Summary)

- AC1: Admin can manage staff lifecycle within quota limits.
- AC2: Staff cannot manage other staff.
- AC3: Archived staff do not break historical records.
- AC4: Disabling staff blocks POS access immediately.
- AC5: Audit log records staff lifecycle changes and assignment changes.
- AC6: Branch assignment is only from system-created branches.
