# Modula Overview

Modula is a modern, modular Point of Sale (POS) platform designed specifically for the Food & Beverage (F&B) industry. It is built with scalability, flexibility, and low entry cost as core principles, enabling small cafés, drink shops, restaurants, and multi-branch chains to operate efficiently while growing into more advanced operational needs.

## Vision
To deliver a high-quality, reliable POS ecosystem that adapts to any stage of a business — from a small street café using a mobile phone to a multi-branch franchise running multiple devices and managing staff attendance.

## Key Principles
### **1. Modular Architecture**
Modula is built as a collection of independent modules (Sales, Menu, Inventory, Attendance, Multi-branch, Cash Sessions, etc.), allowing businesses to enable only what they need.

### **2. Multi-platform Support**
- Mobile phones
- Tablets
- Laptops / Desktops
- Offline-tolerant via IndexedDB (Phase 2)

### **3. Low Cost of Entry**
A small café can run Modula with *just a phone*, without needing specialized POS hardware.

### **4. Gradual Growth Path**
Businesses can start simple (single branch, basic team) and gradually adopt advanced features such as:
- Multi-branch management
- Staff attendance
- Cash session & reconciliation
- Hardware integrations (printers, scanners) (Phase 2+)

### **5. Reliable for Real Operations**
Even though Modula started as a capstone project, its design is aligned with startup-quality standards: audit trails, role-based access control, modular backend, scalable frontend, and a clean evolution path to enterprise-grade features.
